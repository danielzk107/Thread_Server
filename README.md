# Thread_Server
A simple server that accepts multiple clients using multithreading. To generate an executable file for the server, type "make server" or "make all" in a terminal inside the folder the files are in.
After generating the executable file, type "./server" to run it. After you've done that, the server will be up and ready to accept clients.
